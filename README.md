- Installation Instructions:
    
    **Flask Backend Initial Setup**
    1. Navigate into the backend folder
    2. Once the packages have been installed, create a virtual environment with this command 
        ```sh

        ```sh
        python -m venv <name of environment>
        ``` 
        (depending on what version of python you have)
    3. Once this command is complete, you should see an env (or a folder named after whatever you have chosen for the name) folder in your backend folder.
    4. To switch into the virtual environment: 
        ```sh
        <name of environment>\Scripts\activate
        ```
    5. Once in the virtual environment, your terminal should look like this: 
        ```sh
        (env) C:\Users\jturk\Documents\Seneca\BSD\BTP405\Project One\BTP-Project-One\backend>
        ```
    6. Run this command when inside the virtual environment and in the backend folder:  
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    7. Set FLASK_APP environment variable: 
        ```sh
        set FLASK_APP=app.py
        ``` 
        or 
        ```sh
        $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
        ``` 
        (depending on if you're using Command Prompt or PowerShell)
    8. Run the command: 
        ```sh
        flask run
        ``` 
        to start the backend server.
    9. Lastly, if you want to exit the environment, you can use 
        ```sh
        deactivate
        ```

    **Vue Frontend Initial Setup**

    2. Follow the installer wizard and install PostgreSQL.
    3. Add PostgreSQL's bin directory to the PATH environment variable:
        - Find your file path (ex: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin).
        - Use the win + r shortcut to bring up the Run dialog and enter `sysdm.cpl`.
        - Select the Advanced tab at the top and click the `Environment Variables` button at the bottom.
        - In environment variables you want to use the bottom section that says `System`.
        - Under `System` you want to find the `Path` variable and click on the `Edit` button.
        - Once `Edit` is clicked you can click `New` and add your bin path `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin` to the environment variable.
